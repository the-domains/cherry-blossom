# About Me

As a graphic designer most of my adult life has been spent working on editorial design, but I now have the flexibility in my time to explore past interests such as illustration, painting (I have no preferences over one. I work in oil, acrylic or watercolour), and photography. 

I love to travel (though I've not had that opportunity in a while), especially somewhere with a beach and sunshine. 

Food, and cooking, is a long-lasting passion. If I hear of somewhere exciting and new I will go and try it out. If I'm cooking I'll experiment; the results of course vary from perfection to disaster. ![Chashuu Pork](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3bf2f412-c268-47fe-b816-698bdf30a2e9.jpg)
